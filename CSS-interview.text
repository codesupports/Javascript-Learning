-----------------------Specificity Calculation:--------------------------
The specificity is calculated based on a four-part system:

Inline styles (styles written directly in the HTML element's style attribute).
IDs (selectors that use an id).
Classes, pseudo-classes, and attributes.
Elements (or tags) and pseudo-elements.
Each part contributes to the specificity score, which is expressed as a 4-part number: a, b, c, d.

Specificity Scoring:
Inline styles: 1, 0, 0, 0 (This always has the highest specificity).
IDs: 0, 1, 0, 0 (One #id selector adds one to the second part).
Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes: 0, 0, 1, 0 (One .class, [attribute], or :pseudo-class adds one to the third part).
Elements and pseudo-elements: 0, 0, 0, 1 (One div, p, :before, or :after adds one to the fourth part).

Difference between  :nth-child and :nth-of-type.
